routes and server

require statements

mongo data model / schema √
  key: date
  value: to-do list

CRUD
  creating new list on load null
  reading list on load
    collection view √
  updating list on change
    todo completion
    ordering
    changing description
  creating new list at day end (4am) (see ***)

server should not be stateful
  caching in front of db is separate

new list flow
  a. let user edit when day is past and frontend still loaded
      let user edit past days
  b. don't let user edit when day is past

  after 4am server will know if it the first request of a new day
    and respond with the new empty list
  ***"what day is it (what time is it?)?" and "is today's list made yet?"
    always ask db for today's list
      if it's not there, make a blank one
